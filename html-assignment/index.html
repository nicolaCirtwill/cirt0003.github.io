            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Nicola</strong>, born December 29<sup>th</sup>, I am an aspiring illustrator and
                designer with a passion for cats, cool things, cute things, and the colour pink. Born and raised in
                Ottawa <abbr title="Ontario">ON</abbr>, I spent much of my time in Kingston growing up and Halifax after
                high school;Autumn is my favourite season all across Canada because of the colours of the leaves and it
                is not too cold yet. I am currently a first term student in the <abbr

            <p>I like to make crafts and paint in my free time, I make my friends and family bead charms and figurines
                when I am not working or at school or doing schoolwork. Lately due to the winter weather, I like to stay
                at home, bake sugar and snacks, and put together puzzles or play games with my friends.</p>
